# Service Messages

Slurm-web offers the possibility to display custom service message below the
login form. This can be used to communicate information to all users very
efficiently.

To use this feature, just create file
[.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/messages/login.md`# and write your custom message in
markdown format (with links, emphasis, lists, etcâ€¦). It is then automatically
rendered and displayed to all unauthenticated users.

For exemple, consider the following message:

[source,markdown]
----
# _Welcome_ to **Big Corp** HPC Clusters!

Access is restricted to:

* *engineers*
* *researchers*

Login with your **enterprise login** and **password**.

Read [documentation](https://docs.bigcorp.com) to get more information.
----

This example is rendered like this:

CAUTION: This login service message is available to everyone who has network
access to the web interface, including users who are not members of
xref:conf/gateway.adoc#_ldap[LDAP restricted groups]. Take care to avoid
disclosing too much sensitive information in this message.
