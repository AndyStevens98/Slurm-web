= Metrics Export

Slurm-web agent can export metrics in standard OpenMetrics format on `/metrics`
endpoint. This is designed to be scraped by Prometheus (or compatible) in order
to store metrics in timeseries databases and draw diagrams of historical data.

This page explains how to enable and secure this feature by
<<restrict,restricting access>> to specific hosts and
<<prometheus,configure Prometheus>> to scrap these metrics. It also provides a
<<reference,reference list of all available metrics>>. 

== Configuration

The metrics export feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled with the
following lines in [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`#:

[source,ini]
----
[metrics]
enabled=yes
----

.More details
****
* xref:conf/agent.adoc#_metrics[Agent configuration metrics section reference documentation].
****

[#restrict]
== Host Restriction

For security reasons, Slurm-web agent restrict access to `/metrics` endpoint to
localhost only. When Prometheus is running on external hosts, you must define
`restrict` parameter in [.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/agent.ini`# to allow other
networks explicitely. For example:

[source,ini]
----
[metrics]
enabled=yes
restrict=
  192.168.1.0/24
  10.0.0.251/32
----

In this example, all IP addresses in range `192.168.1.[0-254]` and `10.0.0.251`
are permitted to request metrics.

[#prometheus]
== Prometheus Integration

Prometheus must be configured to request `/metrics` endpoint of Slurm-web agent.
Edit [.path]#`/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`# to add one of the following
configuration snippets depending of your setup:

* Slurm-web agent running as native service (ie. with
`slurm-web-agent.service`):

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: slurm
    scrape_interval: 30s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:5012']
----

* Slurm-web agent running on xref:wsgi/index.adoc[production HTTP server]:

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: slurm
    scrape_interval: 30s
    metrics_path: /agent/metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:80']
----

NOTE: You may need to adjust the target hostname, typically if Prometheus is
running on a remote host, and destination port (for example 443 for HTTPS).
